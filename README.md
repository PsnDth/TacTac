## About the Stage
Just a mix of comp. stage stuff that I like all in one place so:
 - Pokemon Colosseum (SSF2)
 - Tower of Salvation (SSF2)
 - Yoshi's Story, but only the randall part!

## Hazards ON
This is the main event, press the opposite direction during basically animation to cancel it. If you cancel 4 attacks very quickly, you'll be blocked from cancelling for a short time. Cancelling shield and ledge options also count towards this limit. You don't get any resources back when cancelling so be careful when done offstage.

## Credits
Thanks to Kactus Guy and J-Dudd for trying it out and giving feedback. Base stage stuff was based on a trace of a trace of Pepperpain so shout out to Carolyn Jong

## Other stuff
This is roughly a speed run project, altho took a break after releasing for initial testing. Kinda stopped keeping track properly after that. overall time breakdown:

ART: 7 hours + 4ish hours of BG elements

CODE: 4 hours + 2 hours of fine tuning and stuff

VIDEO: 4 hours

I don't remember how long I spent playtesting, probably like 4-ish hours but imma not count it bc it was mostly just fooling around outside. Video playtesting is included in that time

I may go back to fix stuff like some of the art. It currently just uses in-game music, so if you have suggestions, send me the audio file on discord (@psndth)
